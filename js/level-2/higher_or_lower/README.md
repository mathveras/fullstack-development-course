# Higher or Lower?

A simple web UI where the user can compare multiple numeric entries.

## Features

- Display highest, lowest and total entries
- Display ascending and descending entries order

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## How it works?

1. The user has to enter at least 2 valid numbers, integer or float
2. If desired, the user can click `Add Number (+)` to display more entry boxes
3. The user can click `Compare Numbers` or press the `Enter` key to compare all the entries. If at least 2 entries are valid, the highest entry, lowest entry, ascending and descending orders will be displayed by the program

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML structure of the program
- `styles.css`: CSS page styles
- `number_comparator.js`: Program's logic and interactivity

## Future Improvements (Maybe, if I remember...)

- More themes
- Change "Maximum of 10 numbers reached" to a UI warning.
- Seemless animations.
- Switch between entering in multiple entry boxes and a single boxes with an array of numbers
