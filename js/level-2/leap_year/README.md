# Leap Year

A simple web UI to check if a year is a leap year or not.

## Features

- If a leap year is detected, a green text box will displayed
- If not a leap year, a red text box will be displayed

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## How it works?

1. The user enters a a valid number
2. If the number is evenly divisible by 4, it will be displayed as a leap year
3. If the number is not divisible by 4, it will not be displayed as a leap year

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML structure of the program
- `styles.css`: CSS page styles
- `check_leap_year.js`: Program's logic and interactivity

## Future Improvements (Maybe, if I remember...)

- More themes
- Accept multiple entries
